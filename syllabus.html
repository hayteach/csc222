        <h3>Access to Computers on Campus:</h3>
        <p>The following computers should be able to run any of your class assignments without obnoxiously long delays:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>DAM Computers in Library:</strong> There are 8 computers available with Wacom Touch monitors.  These are available whenever the Library is open (check library site for times during the semester).</li>
            <li>There are also computers available in the lab area where Dr. Pai's Office is. If you want or need to use these while on campus, you need to contact Dr. Pai to set up an agreeable time/schedule.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>💻 Required Hardware:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>PC/Mac (basically, if it can run a browser and doesn't sound like a jet engine, you're golden! ✈️)</li>

        <h2 id="description">📖 COURSE DESCRIPTION (The Fun Stuff!)</h2>
        <p>Ready to level up your coding game? 🎮 This course is where the magic happens! We'll explore the art and science of data structures and algorithms - think of them as the LEGO blocks of programming. You'll learn how to build elegant, efficient programs that would make even experienced developers nod in approval. Warning: You may develop an unhealthy obsession with Big O notation. 😅</p>

        <h3>🎯 Course Objectives/Learning Outcomes (aka What You'll Be Able to Brag About): </h3>
        
        <h4>Course Objectives:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>📊 Write programs that use each of the following data structures: arrays, records, strings, linked-lists, stacks, queues and hash tables (collect 'em all!).</li>
            <li>🔄 Implement, test and debug simple recursive functions and procedures (inception for code!).</li>
            <li>⚖️ Evaluate tradeoffs in lifetime management (reference counting vs garbage collection) - it's like choosing between pizza toppings, but for memory!</li>
            <li>🧩 Explain how abstraction mechanisms support the creation of reusable software components (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself!).</li>
            <li>🎨 Design, implement, test, and debug simple programs in an object-oriented programming language.</li>
            <li>🤔 Compare and contrast object-oriented analysis and design with structured analysis and design.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Learning Outcomes:</h4>
        <p>Upon successful completion of the course the student should be able to: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Write programs that implement and use each of the following data structures: arrays, records, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, and hash tables.</li>
            <li>Compare iterative and recursive solutions for elementary problems such as factorial. </li>
            <li>Compare and contrast object-oriented analysis and design with structured analysis and design.</li>
            <li>Discuss the representation and use of primitive data types and built-in data structures.</li>
            <li>Choose the appropriate data structure for modeling a given problem.</li>
            <li>Identify and describe the properties of a variable such as its associated address, value, scope, persistence, and size.</li>
            <li>Describe how the class mechanism supports encapsulation and information hiding.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> You will see these learning outcomes at times in the grading rubrics for assignments. When you see one, it means that I feel that all or part of this assignment allows you to demonstrate your ability to meet this outcome.

        <p>Let's keep it real and respectful! Think of this class as a coding dojo - we're all here to learn and help each other grow. Be cool, be kind, and be honest in your work. For specific guidelines please refer to Administrative Procedures.</p>

        <h3>🚫 Cheating (Don't Do It!)</h3>
        <p>Listen, we get it - sometimes code gets tough. But copying someone else's work and slapping your name on it? That's a no-go. Not only will you miss out on learning, but you could lose credit, get dropped from the course, or face even bigger consequences. When in doubt, ask for help instead! We're all about learning here. 💪</p>

        <h3>Students with Disabilities</h3>
        <p>The College is committed to creating a learning environment that meets the needs of its diverse student body. If you anticipate or experience any barriers to learning in this course, please feel welcome to discuss your concerns with me.</p>
        
        <div class="note">
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> Special accommodations will not be provided without documentation of your disability from the DRC (Disability Resources Center).
        </div>

        <h3 id="ai-usage">🤖 AI Usage Policy (Yes, We're Living in the Future!)</h3>
        <p>So, AI is a thing now, right? Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT are like having a really smart (but sometimes quirky) coding buddy. You CAN use them in this course - but with great power comes great responsibility! Think of AI as your study partner, not your replacement brain. 🧠✨</p>
        
        <h4>Permitted Uses of AI:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Learning and Understanding:</strong> Use AI to help explain concepts, debug code, or understand error messages.</li>
            <li><strong>Code Review:</strong> Use AI to review your code for best practices, optimization suggestions, or potential bugs.</li>
            <li><strong>Brainstorming:</strong> Use AI to explore different approaches to solving a problem or implementing a data structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Use AI to help generate or improve code comments and documentation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Required Practices:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Understanding:</strong> You must understand any code that you submit. If asked to explain your code, you should be able to do so clearly.</li>
            <li><strong>Attribution:</strong> When AI generates significant portions of your code, include a comment indicating this (e.g., "// AI-assisted implementation").</li>
            <li><strong>Testing:</strong> All code, whether AI-generated or not, must be tested and verified by you to ensure it works correctly.</li>
            <li><strong>Learning Focus:</strong> AI should supplement your learning, not replace it. Use AI as a tutor, not as a solution provider.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Prohibited Uses:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Exams:</strong> AI tools may not be used during examinations unless explicitly permitted.</li>
            <li><strong>Blind Copying:</strong> Copying AI-generated code without understanding it is considered academic dishonesty.</li>
            <li><strong>Misrepresentation:</strong> Submitting AI-generated work as entirely your own without attribution is a violation of academic integrity.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The goal of this course is to develop your problem-solving skills and understanding of data structures and algorithms. While AI can be a valuable tool, over-reliance on it will prevent you from achieving the learning outcomes of this course. Remember: in interviews and professional settings, you'll need to demonstrate your own knowledge and skills.
        </div>

        <h3>⏰ Makeup and Late Work (Time is of the Essence!): </h3>
        <p>Here's the deal: For Exams and the Final Project, <strong>NO LATE SUBMISSIONS</strong> will be accepted (seriously, don't test this! ⚠️). For everything else, late work gets dinged <strong>1% per day</strong> - think of it as a "procrastination tax." Canvas will handle this automatically, so no begging or bribing necessary. 😊</p>

        <h3>👻 Absenteeism (aka The Disappearing Student Syndrome):</h3>
        <p>Look, this is a hybrid course - there's no "I forgot to show up" excuse. But there IS a "I haven't checked Canvas in three weeks and now I'm panicking" problem. Don't be that person! Pro tip from past successful students: Check in regularly, stay on top of assignments, and you'll cruise through this course like a boss. 😎</p>

        <h4>🚨 The "We've Heard It All Before" List (aka NOT Valid Excuses):</h4>
        <p>Look, we're all human and life happens. But these excuses have been retired from active duty:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>💻 "My computer broke" (Back up your work! Cloud storage is your friend!)</li>
            <li>📡 "No or lost Internet" (Libraries, coffee shops, campus - Wi-Fi is everywhere!)</li>
            <li>👔 "Busy at work or work schedule change" (Plan ahead, friend!)</li>
            <li>✈️ "Work traveling" (Laptops are portable for a reason!)</li>
            <li>😰 "Personal issues" (We care, but communication is key!)</li>
            <li>📚 "Busy in other classes" (Time management is part of college life!)</li>
            <li>📖 "Still don't have book or class materials" (Good news: no textbook required!)</li>
            <li>😴 "Forgot the course started" (Canvas notifications are a thing!)</li>
            <li>🤷 "Spaced out the homework and assignments" (Happens to the best of us - set reminders!)</li>
            <li>📅 "Didn't follow due dates or read the assignment schedule" (Syllabus = your roadmap!)</li>
            <li>🛫 "Stuck at an airport with no Internet" (Most airports have Wi-Fi now!)</li>
            <li>❓ "Didn't know what assignments were due" (Check Canvas regularly!)</li>
            <li>🤧 "Flu, cold, etc. without notification" (Communication is everything!)</li>
            <li>🏥 "Chronic health issues not registered with DRC" (Please register at the start if applicable!)</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 15px;">Bottom line: Life happens, but communicate early and often if you need help! We're here for you. 💙</p>

        <h2 id="schedule">COURSE SCHEDULE</h2>
        <div class="note">
            <strong>NOTE: </strong> All assignments are considered on-time if they are submitted by time specified on the assignment. If no time is specified, the assignment is due by 11:59pm on that date.  You are expected to have completed the reading and any other preparation before the due date.
        </div>

        <h3>ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION: </h3>
        <p>All assignments are expected to be submitted as defined in the assignment description and NO LATER THAN the provided Due Date. All students are welcome and highly encouraged to submit any assignments before the due date. </p>

        <p>Since this is a Hybrid Class we will be meeting once a week and you are expected to participate and contribute to the class. </p>

        <h4>📝 Homework/Quizzes (Practice Makes Perfect!)</h4>
        <p>Each section comes with its own homework assignment - think of them as XP points for your coding skills! 🎮</p>
        <ul>
            <li>🕐 All HW assignments are <strong>untimed</strong> - no pressure! Take a deep breath, grab some coffee ☕, and work at your own pace.</li>
            <li>🔄 You can submit as many times as you want! We keep your highest score, so feel free to retry until you nail it. It's like a video game with unlimited lives!</li>
            <li>🎲 Each time you open a HW, you'll get some different questions - keeps things fresh and helps you learn better!</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> YOU MUST attempt each section HW assignment and score at least 50% before the next section will open up for you. You may always go back and retry/submit for a higher grade at any time up to the final deadline.
        </div>

        <p>It is your responsibility to complete and submit your assignments as indicated and in a timely manner. The points earned (or not earned) are based on your performance. </p>

        <h4>🔬 Labs (Hands-On Learning!)</h4>
        <p>Lab assignments are where theory meets practice! These hands-on exercises will help you apply the concepts you're learning in a practical, guided way. 💻</p>
        <ul>
            <li>🧪 Labs are designed to reinforce lecture material and give you real coding experience with data structures and algorithms.</li>
            <li>👥 Some labs may be completed individually, while others might be pair-programming exercises (we'll let you know!).</li>
            <li>📋 Each lab comes with clear instructions and expected outcomes - follow them carefully!</li>
            <li>✅ Labs must be completed and submitted by the specified deadline to receive full credit.</li>
            <li>🆘 Stuck? That's what office hours and class time are for! Don't wait until the last minute to ask for help.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>💻 Programming Assignments</h4>
        <p>There are several programs that will be required for this course. All programs will be included in your final grade. One to two of these assignments may be a "team" assignment. Teams will be assigned by the instructor.</p>

        <h4>📝 Exams</h4>
        <p>There will be a midterm exam that covers the first half of the course.  In this exam, you should expect to answer questions similar to those from the quizzes and to also answer some programming based questions.</p>

        <h4>Final Project</h4>
        <p>A final project may be required and is a major program which will take some significant time to complete so plan accordingly. </p>

        <h3>GRADE DISTRIBUTION</h3>
        <p>Grades are awarded on a straight percentage basis: </p>
        
        <table class="grade-table">
            <tr>
                <th>Grade</th>

        <h2 id="about">ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>Hi, My name is Heidi Ahders and I will be your instructor for this course. I am originally from the San Francisco East Bay.  I graduated from Acalanes High School in Lafayette.  After I graduated from high school, I attended Diablo Valley Community College and transferred to Sonoma State University where I received my B.A. in Mathematics and a teaching credential.in Mathematics. </p>

        <p>My husband then was accepted to Oregon State University so we moved to Corvallis, OR where I continued to be a substitute teacher.  In 1993 we had our son and at which time I took some time off from teaching. </p>

        <p>I eventually decided to return to school and received my Masters degree in Mathematics Education from Oregon State University in 1996. And after teaching for a year, I started my path in the computer field. I was given an opportunity to intern at HP in the Inkjet Division.  This gave me the opportunity to create webpages, learn to program and work in the private sector. This led to contracting work in the computer field. </p>

        <p>In 1998, Roger was hired at Mendocino College and I was hired on his coat tails as a part-time math instructor. We then had our daughter in 1999 and I didn't want to leave her so I started teaching at night and online courses in Mathematics. I continued to do consulting work in computer science, and then had the opportunity to get my second Masters, this time in Computer Science. I graduated from Georgia Institute of Technology in December of 2018. Since then I have been teaching and also had the pleasure to work as a Lead Software Engineer at Wells Fargo. I am currently working on side projects that hopefully will lead to more opportunities in the future. </p>

        <p>I hope that I learn more from you than you learn from me and that everyone has a great semester! </p>
