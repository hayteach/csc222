COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course will explore the application of software engineering techniques, data structures, and associated algorithms to the design and development of computer programs. Programs are written in an appropriate and modern object-oriented language.(C-ID: COMP-132)

Course Objectives/Learning Outcomes:
Course Objectives:
Write programs that use each of the following data structures: arrays, records, strings, linked-lists, stacks, queues and hash tables.
Implement, test and debug simple recursive functions and procedures.
Evaluate tradeoffs in lifetime management (reference counting vs garbage collection)
Explain how abstraction mechanisms support the creation of reusable software components.
Design, implement, test, and debug simple programs in an object-oriented programming language.
Compare and contrast object-oriented analysis and design with structured analysis and design.
Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of the course the student should be able to:

Write programs that implement and use each of the following data structures: arrays, records, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, and hash tables.
Compare iterative and recursive solutions for elementary problems such as factorial.
Compare and contrast object-oriented analysis and design with structured analysis and design.
Discuss the representation and use of primitive data types and built-in data structures.
Choose the appropriate data structure for modeling a given problem.
Identify and describe the properties of a variable such as its associated address, value, scope, persistence, and size.
Describe how the class mechanism supports encapsulation and information hiding.

NOTE: You will see these at times in the grading rubrics for assignments. When you see one, it means that I feel that all or part of this assignment allows you to demonstrate your ability to meet this objective. Your score on each objective, will be between 0 and 1 with 1 being full understanding/demonstration  (of at least the portion provided in the assignment), 0.7 meaning adequate or satisfactory understanding/demonstration, and levels below meaning, at this point, you need more support in achieving the desired course outcome.

COURSE POLICIES:
Student Conduct and Academic Honesty

Students are expected to behave courteous and respectful manner which is conducive to learning. Students should not engage in academic misconduct. For specific guidelines please refer to Admin Procedure 5500.1 (Links to an external site.) for the Student Conduct Guidelines and Admin Procedure 5500.2 (Links to an external site.) on academic honesty.If you are not familiar with these, you should review them as these standards will be the expectation in this class.

Cheating

Cheating is not doing the work that you put your name on. A student will not receive any credit and may be dropped from the course or expelled from the school. Refer to the college handbook for more information. No further warnings are issued. The homework lab assignments are NOT group projects unless specifically clarified by the instructor as a group activity. Labs done in class, of course, will be identical for “teams” and that is expected since you are working with a partner.  You must do your own work to receive credit for it. If you give your work using any method to another student, you are also guilty of cheating.

 Student’s with Disabilities

The College is committed to creating a learning environment that meets the needs of its diverse student body. If you anticipate or experience any barriers to learning in this course, please feel welcome to discuss your concerns with me. If you have a disability, or think you may have a disability, you may also want to meet with a Counselor at the Disability Resource Center to begin this conversation or request an official accommodation. The staff at the Disability Resource Center can be reached at (707) 468-3031 or drc@mendocino.edu. It is my goal to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we can explore potential options.

NOTE: Special accommodations will not be provided without documentation of your disability from the DRC.

Makeup and Late Work:

For the Exams and Project, NO LATE SUBMISSIONS will be accepted. For all other categories, all late submissions could suffer a 1% per day (or portion of a day) late penalty. These rules will be coded into the Gradebook on Canvas so it will automatically be applied upon grading. 

Absenteeism:

There really is no “absenteeism” in an online course other than not checking the course site. The best way to do well in this course is to stay caught up with your work each week. Historically, the individuals that do not do well in my courses are those that choose to procrastinate and try to do a lot of work in a very short period of time instead of doing a little bit throughout each week. 

The following examples (but not limited to) are not considered circumstances for not "attending" class, late assignment extensions, makeup quizzes and/or exams, and any other assignments past the due date SO PLAN ACCORDING.  Avoid being a procrastinator and plan for “life” circumstances.

Computer broke
No or lost Internet
Busy at work or work schedule change
Work traveling
Personal issues
Busy in other classes
Still do not have book or class materials
Forgot the course started
Spaced out the homework and assignments
Did not follow due dates or read the assignment schedule
Stuck at an airport with no Internet
Did not know what the assignments were or when they were due
Flu, cold, etc. (without notification of onset and doctor excuse)
Chronic health issues not registered with the disability resources office at the college at the start of class. If not registered, no special accommodations are made. (You may want to contact the college Disability Resources office to see if you qualify for special arrangements.)
COURSE SCHEDULE:
Note, all assignments are considered on-time if they are submitted by time specified on the assignment. If no time is specified, the assignment is due by 11:59pm on that date. You are expected to have completed the reading for any given week PRIOR to the first class that week.
ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION:

All assignments are expected to be submitted as defined in the assignment description and NO LATER THAN the provided Due Date. All students are welcome and highly encouraged to submit any assignments early. Please note that when you wait until the last minute to submit an assignment, you run the risk of being late due to technical difficulties. In general, technical difficulties are not valid excuses for late work submission. If you are unsure of how something should be turned in, you should try it early (can always resubmit up to the due date with no restrictions or penalties) and ask questions.

Discussion - None

Since this is a Hybrid Class we will be meeting once a week and you are expected to participate and contribute to the class

Homework/quizzes 

In general, there is an online homework assignment for each section of this course. 

All HW assignments are untimed and you may submit them as many times as you wish with your highest score recorded as your final grade. Each time you open a HW, you should get at least some different questions. You may review your answers after each attempt.

YOU MUST attempt each section HW assignment and score at least 50% before the next section will open up for you.  You may always go back and retry/submit for a higher grade at any time up to the final week of the semester

It is your responsibility to complete and submit your assignments as indicated and in a timely manner. The points earned (or not earned) are based on your performance.

Programming 

There are several programs that will be required for this course. All programs will be included in your final grade. One to two of these assignments may be a "team" assignment. Teams will be assigned by the instructor based upon student participation up to the time teams are assigned.

Exams

There will be  a midterm exam that covers the first half of the course. In this exam, you should expect to answer questions similar to those from the quizzes and to also answer some programming based questions. Exams are scheduled,  SO PLAN ACCORDINGLY OR YOU WILL GET 0 POINTS FOR EXAMS NOT TAKEN.  Please contact me should there be extenuating circumstances (death in the family, emergency out-of-town trip, etc.) that would cause you to miss taking an exam. Check the syllabus for exam due dates.

Final Project

A final project may be required and is a major program which will take some significant time to complete so plan accordingly. 

GRADE DISTRIBUTION

Grades are awarded on a straight percentage basis:

A: 90% and up
B: 80% to < 90%
C: 70% to < 80%
D: 60% to < 70%
F: <60%

OTHER INFORMATION

This syllabus/outline may be subject to additions, deletions, and/or changes at the discretion of the instructor or the college district.  The course content may vary from this outline to meet the needs of this particular group. Advance notice of such change shall be given. 

At the time of writing this, some of the assignment details are in flux. Additionally, the schedule for the course is subject to change based upon how well we progress during the semester and any additional information that we may cover (may end up substituting some topics). Any changes to defined assignments will be made early enough to not significantly impact a student's ability to complete it by the specified due date. Additionally, in the event that a change requires the due date to an existing assignment to be moved, said due date will only be moved to a later date and never an earlier date.

Any changes or other important announcements for the course will be posted in the "Announcements" section of the course. It is your responsibility to monitor the Announcements (If you have set your Notifications to not receive Announcements, then it is your responsibility to regularly check them online)

ABOUT ME

Hi, My name is Heidi Ahders and I will be your instructor for this course. I am originally from the San Francisco East Bay. I graduated from Acalanes High School in Lafayette. After I graduated from high school, I attended Diablo Valley College where I completed my general education and then moved on to Sonoma State University where I met my husband, Roger Ahders. I complete my BA in Mathematics there in 1991.  My plan was to become a math teacher either in a junior high or high school. I completed my teaching credential there at Sonoma State in 1992 and began my teaching career as a substitute teacher in Sonoma County. 

My husband then was accepted to Oregon State University so we moved to Corvallis, OR where I continued to be a substitute teacher. In 1993 we had our son and which time I took some time off from teaching to help my family's business where I could take my son to work and spend time with him. I eventually went back to teaching and at the same time decided to pursue a master's degree in math education.

After teaching for a year, I started my path in the computer field. I was given an opportunity to intern at HP in the Inkjet Division. This gave me the opportunity to create webpages. This led to contract job within HP for the Mobile Computing Division, where I created a web application. I was also working part-time at the School District in the Technology Department where I created a district-wide application. 

In 1998, Roger was hired at Mendocino College and I was hired on his coat tails as a part-time math instructor.  We then had our daughter in 1999 and I didn't want to leave her so I started teaching online and at night. I loved working on computers, specifically programming, web and application development, so decided to move to teaching in the computer science department where I could teach online. I started working on a Master's in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology and in 2018 received my degree. 

I hope that I learn more from you than you learn from me and that everyone has a great semester.
