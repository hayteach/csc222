        </div>

        <h2 id="policies">COURSE POLICIES</h2>
        
        <h3>Student Conduct and Academic Honesty</h3>
        <p>Students are expected to behave in a courteous and respectful manner which is conducive to learning. Students should not engage in academic misconduct. For specific guidelines please refer to Administrative Procedures.</p>

        <h3>Cheating</h3>
        <p>Cheating is not doing the work that you put your name on. A student will not receive any credit and may be dropped from the course or expelled from the school. Refer to the college handbook for more information.</p>

        <h3>Students with Disabilities</h3>
        <p>The College is committed to creating a learning environment that meets the needs of its diverse student body. If you anticipate or experience any barriers to learning in this course, please feel welcome to discuss your concerns with me.</p>
        
        <div class="note">
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> Special accommodations will not be provided without documentation of your disability from the DRC (Disability Resources Center).
        </div>

        <h3>Makeup and Late Work: </h3>
        <p>For the Exams and Project, <strong>NO LATE SUBMISSIONS</strong> will be accepted. For all other categories, all late submissions could suffer a <strong>1% per day</strong> (or portion of a day) late penalty. These rules will be coded into Canvas. </p>

        <h3>Absenteeism:</h3>
        <p>There really is no "absenteeism" in an online course other than not checking the course site. The best way to do well in this course is to stay caught up with your work each week.  Historically, the students who do well are those who check the course site regularly and stay on top of their assignments.</p>

        <h4>The following examples (but not limited to) are NOT considered valid circumstances for late assignment extensions, makeup quizzes and/or exams:</h4>
        <ul>

            <li>Flu, cold, etc.  (without notification of onset and doctor excuse)</li>
            <li>Chronic health issues not registered with the disability resources office at the college at the start of class</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="schedule">COURSE SCHEDULE</h2>
        <div class="note">
            <strong>NOTE: </strong> All assignments are considered on-time if they are submitted by time specified on the assignment. If no time is specified, the assignment is due by 11:59pm on that date.  You are expected to have completed the reading and any other preparation before the due date.
        </div>

        <h3>ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION: </h3>
        <p>All assignments are expected to be submitted as defined in the assignment description and NO LATER THAN the provided Due Date. All students are welcome and highly encouraged to submit any assignments before the due date. </p>

        <h4>Discussion - None</h4>
        <p>Since this is a Hybrid Class we will be meeting once a week and you are expected to participate and contribute to the class. </p>

        <h4>Homework/Quizzes</h4>
        <p>In general, there is an online homework assignment for each section of this course. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>All HW assignments are untimed and you may submit them as many times as you wish with your highest score recorded as your final grade.</li>
            <li>Each time you open a HW, you should get at least some different questions. </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> YOU MUST attempt each section HW assignment and score at least 50% before the next section will open up for you. You may always go back and retry/submit for a higher grade at any time up to the final deadline.
        </div>

        <p>It is your responsibility to complete and submit your assignments as indicated and in a timely manner. The points earned (or not earned) are based on your performance. </p>

        <h4>Programming</h4>
        <p>There are several programs that will be required for this course. All programs will be included in your final grade.  One to two of these assignments may be a "team" assignment.  Teams will be assigned by the instructor.</p>

        <h4>Exams</h4>
        <p>There will be a midterm exam that covers the first half of the course.  In this exam, you should expect to answer questions similar to those from the quizzes and to also answer some programming based questions.</p>

        <h4>Final Project</h4>
        <p>A final project may be required and is a major program which will take some significant time to complete so plan accordingly. </p>

        <h3>GRADE DISTRIBUTION</h3>
        <p>Grades are awarded on a straight percentage basis: </p>
        
        <table class="grade-table">
            <tr>
                <th>Grade</th>

        <h2 id="about">ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>Hi, My name is Heidi Ahders and I will be your instructor for this course. I am originally from the San Francisco East Bay.  I graduated from Acalanes High School in Lafayette.  After I graduated from high school, I attended Cal Poly San Luis Obispo where I received my B.S. in Mathematics. </p>

        <p>My husband then was accepted to Oregon State University so we moved to Corvallis, OR where I continued to be a substitute teacher.  In 1993 we had our son and at which time I took some time off from teaching. </p>

        <p>After teaching for a year, I started my path in the computer field. I was given an opportunity to intern at HP in the Inkjet Division.  This gave me the opportunity to create webpages. This led to contracting work in the computer field. </p>

        <p>In 1998, Roger was hired at Mendocino College and I was hired on his coat tails as a part-time math instructor. We then had our daughter in 1999 and I didn't want to leave her so I started teaching online courses in Mathematics and Computer Science.</p>

        <p>I hope that I learn more from you than you learn from me and that everyone has a great semester! </p>
