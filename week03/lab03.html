<p>Write a program that:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Prompts the user to input the value of an integer.</li>
    <li>Store that input into an "int" called "myVar"</li>
    <li>Create a pointer, "iptr" and store the address of "myVar" in "iptr"</li>
    <li>Print out the value of the integer "myVar", the address of "myVar" (stored in iptr) and the value of the integer stored at the address that "iptr" is pointing to.</li>
    <li>Create an integer array, "myArray" of size "myVar" and fill it with integers from 1 to "myVar"</li>
    <li>Print out the values in "myArray"</li>
    <li>Create a pointer to "myArray" called "ptrToMyArray"</li>
    <li>Print out the values in "myArray" using "ptrToMyArray" to access each value.</li>
    <li>Make sure that your program properly deletes everything and frees memory upon exit.</li>
</ol>
